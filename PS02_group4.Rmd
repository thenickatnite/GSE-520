### Question 1

Suppose someone proposes that the quantity of movies demanded is related to price and income by the linear equation, 
$$quantity = 120 - 9.8 price + .03 income$$

a. What is the interpretation of the number $120$ in the equation above?

>**Solution:**  
The number $120$ represents the intercept of the linear equation. So if $price=0$ and $income=0$ then the quantity of movies demanded would be $120$.

b. What is the interpretation of the number $9.8$ in the equation above?  Is this a marginal effect?  If so, of what?

>**Solution:**  
As the price of movies increase, the demand from movies would decline. Using numbers from the example, if price increased by 1, then the demand for movies would decrease by 9.8. This is the marginal effect of price on the demand of movies: 
$$\dfrac{\partial quantity}{\partial price} = -9.8$$

c. What is the demand for movies if $price=15$ and $income=200$?  What does this suggest about using linear functions to describe demand curves?

>**Solution:**  
$$quantity = 120 - 9.8(15) + .03(200)$$
>```{r}
# 1.c
price = 15
income = 200
quantity = 120 - 9.8*(price) + .03*(income)
print(quantity)
```
>The quantity of movies demanded would be -21 using the parameters given to us. So this suggests that linear functions may not be the most accurate way to describe demand curves, as it is impossible to demand a negative amount of movies.

### Question 2

Let $prate$ be the fraction of employees participating in a 401K plan (401K's are employer sponsored retirement savings plans).  Let $mrate$ be the match rate, for example if a person's salary is \$100K and the match rate is 4.07, then the employer will match the employees 401K contribution up to the amount of \$4,070.  Suppose the function relating $mrate$ to $prate$ is described by 
$$prate = 83.1 + 5.9(mrate)$$

a. How do you interpret the intercept?
  
>**Solution:**  
The intercept represents the fraction of people who would participate in the 401k program when the employer match rate is 0. So if $mrate = 0$ then $prate = 83.1$ and $\frac{83.1}{100}$ would be the fraction of employees who still contribute to the 401k plan.

b. Do the parameters of this function appear to be the `right' sign, i.e. would it make more sense if the coefficient on $mrate$ was negative?

>**Solution:**  
The parameters of the function do appear to be the 'right' sign. If an employer is offering to match some of the employees contribution to the employee's retirement plan, you would expect more employees to contribute to their 401k. If not, they would be losing out on "free money" so to speak.

c. Consider a quadratic function 
$$prate = 78.6 + 17(mrate) - 3.2(mrate^2)$$
Take the derivative of this function with respect to $mrate$ and show that the marginal effect of $mrate$ on $prate$ depends on the current level of $mrate$.

>**Solution:**  
\begin{align*}
\dfrac{d(prate)}{d(mrate)} = & 17 - (2)(3.2)(mrate)\\
   = & 17 - (6.4)(mrate)\\
\end{align*}

d. Sketch the general shape of the quadratic function with $prate$ on the y-axis and $mrate$ on the x-axis.  Use the code below (see what it looks like in the HTML) to upload your sketch.

````
```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="A caption", out.width = '100%'}`r ''`
knitr::include_graphics("temp.png")
```
````

>**Solution:**  
>```{r}
x = 0:10
y = 78.6 + 17*(x) - 3.2*(x)^2
plot(x,y,'l')
```


e. Given the quadratic function above, at what value of $mrate$ does increasing $mrate$ actually begin decreasing $prate$?

>**Solution:**  
To find the maximum of $mrate$, you would need to take the first derivative of $prate$ and set it equal to zero. We already have the first derivative of $prate$ from question 2.c, so we use that and set it equal to zero, then solve for $mrate$:  
$$ \dfrac{d(prate)}{d(mrate)} = 17 - (6.4)(mrate)$$
\begin{align*}
& 0 = 17 - (6.4)(mrate)\\
& (6.4)(mrate) = 17\\
& mrate = \frac{17}{6.4}\\
\end{align*}  
The value of $mrate$ that is a maximum (found by first derivative and looking at graph) is $\frac{17}{6.4}$. So any value of $mrate$ after $\frac{17}{6.4}$ would reduce the value of $prate$.

### Question 3

Next let's consider interpreting functions with the natural log.  Suppose that the one way ticket price, $fare$, for an airline ticket is a function of distance (in 100 miles), $dist$, through the equation:
$$\ln(fare) = a + b \cdot dist$$
with
$$\ln(fare) = 4.666 +  0.043(dist)$$

a. How do you interpret the intercept?  Is it of any use?

>**Solution:**  
The intercept represents the baseline cost of a plane ticket without considering a destination or distance of flight. It is not of any practical use because you cannot buy a plane ticket without a destination or distance. No plane fare would consist of a distance of 0 miles. One could see it as the administrative costs of a plane ticket.

b. Compute the $\ln(fare)$ of a flight that is 100 miles (i.e., $dist=1$).  What is the price in dollars for a flight that is 100 miles?

>**Solution:**  
>```{r}
x = 4.666 + 0.043*(1)
exp(x)
print(exp(x))
```  
The fare of a flight of 100 miles is $110.94.

c. Compute the actual fare in dollars for a flight that is 200 miles.  What unit increase in distance is this compared to the previous question.  What percent increase is this in the fare?  Is this approximately 4.3\%?

>**Solution:**  
>```{r}
y = 4.666 + 0.043*(2)
exp(y)
print(exp(y))
(exp(y)-exp(x))/exp(x)
```
There is a one unit increase in distance compared to the previous question. The percent increase is approximately 4.39% which is approximately 4.3%.

d. Let's formalize this with calculus.  Re-write $fare = \exp(4.666  + 0.043 dist)$.  Take the derivative of this with respect to $dist$ and divide both sides by $fare$.  Show 
$$0.043 = \dfrac{\partial fare/ fare}{\partial dist} = \dfrac{\Delta fare/ fare}{\Delta dist} = \dfrac{\%\Delta fare}{\Delta dist}$$
In a log-level function the coefficient on $dist$ indicates the percentage change in $fare$ given a unit change in distance.  Thus if $dist$ increases by 1 unit (100 miles) the fare will increase by (approximately) 4.3\%

>**Solution:**  
\begin{align*}
fare = & \exp(4.666  + 0.043 dist)\\
\dfrac{d(fare)}{d(dist)} = & (0.043)\exp(4.666 + 0.043)\\
\dfrac{d(fare)}{d(dist)/ fare} = & \frac{(0.043)(fare)}{fare}\\
0.043 = & \dfrac{d(fare)/ fare}{d(dist)}\\
= & \dfrac{\Delta fare/ fare}{\Delta dist} \\
= & \dfrac{\%\Delta fare}{\Delta dist}\\
\end{align*}

### Question 4

Here is an alternative function with natural logs that relates one way ticket price, $fare$, for an airline ticket to distance (in 100 miles), $dist$, through the equation:
$$fare = a + b \cdot \ln(dist)$$
where
$$fare = 41 + 66\ln(dist)$$
a. How does this function differ from the one in the previous problem

>**Solution:**  
The two equations have similar outputs, however the first equation gave us the percent change in fare, given level change in dist while the second equation gives us level change in fare given percent change in dist.  

b. Let $fare =  41+66\ln(dist)$.  We would like to understand how to interpret the coefficient on $\ln(dist)$ (i.e., 66).  Take the derivative of the equation with respect to $dist$ and divide both sides by $1/dist$, show 
$$66 = \dfrac{\partial fare}{\partial dist/dist}= \dfrac{\Delta fare}{\Delta dist/dist} = \dfrac{\Delta fare}{\% \Delta dist}$$
This reads, if the denominator changes by 1 unit (a 100\% increase in distance), the dependent variable $fare$ will increase (approximately) by \$66.  This is a level-log function

>**Solution:**  
\begin{align*}
fare = & 41 + 66\ln(dist)\\
\dfrac{d(fare)}{d(dist)} = & \frac{66}{dist}\\
\frac{\dfrac{d(fare)}{d(dist)}}{\frac{1}{dist}} = & \frac{\frac{66}{dist}}{\frac{1}{dist}}\\
66 = & \dfrac{\partial fare}{\partial dist/dist}\\
= & \dfrac{\Delta fare}{\Delta dist/dist}\\
= & \dfrac{\Delta fare}{\% \Delta dist}\\
\end{align*}

c. Your calculation above suggests that if $dist$ increases by 100\%, $fare$ should increase by \$66.  Check to see if this is true by comparing the actual $fare$ of a flight that is 400 miles to a flight that is 200 miles.

>**Solution:**  
>```{r}
x = 41 + 66*log(400)
print(x)

y = 41 + 66*log(200)
print(y)

x - y
```
Does not appear to be a good approximation. The actual fares of flights with distances 400 and 200 are \$436.44 and \$390.69 with a difference in fare of $45.75 when we expected a difference in fare of $66.

d. If a 100\% change in $dist$ leads to an approximate increase in fare of \$66, what would you expect the approximate increase in $fare$ to be if $dist$ increased by 10\%? Check to see if this is a good approximation by comparing the actual fare difference for a flight that is 220 miles to a flight that is 200 miles?

>**Solution:**  
Since this is a level-log equation, we know the level change is equal to $\frac{b}{100}$ given 1\% change in x. With a 1\% change in dist, that would give us $\frac{66}{100}$ and with a 10\% we would expect a 6.6 level change in fare. 
>```{r}
x = 41 + 66*log(220)
print(x)

y = 41 + 66*log(200)
print(y)

x - y
```
Appears to be a better approximation. We expected a \$6.6 change in fare and had a \$6.29 change.

e. If a 100\% change in $dist$ leads to an approximate increase in fare of \$66, what would you expect the approximate increase in $fare$ to be if $dist$ increased by 1\%? Check to see if this is a good approximation by comparing the actual fare difference for a flight that is 202 miles to a flight that is 200 miles?

>**Solution:**  
Since this is a level-log equation, we know the level change is equal to $\frac{b}{100}$ given 1\% change in x. With a 1\% change in dist, that would give us $\frac{66}{100}$.
>```{r}
x = 41 + 66*log(202)
print(x)

y = 41 + 66*log(200)
print(y)

x - y
```
We would estimate a change of \$.66 and had a change of \$.66. This is a great approximation.

f. What can you conclude about the percentage change interpretation on the coefficient on a natural log variable.  When is it a good approximation, when considering small percentage changes or large percentage changes?

>**Solution:**  
We can conclude that the percentage change interpretation on the coefficient on a natural log variable is a good approximation with small percentage changes, and bad with large percentage changes.

### Question 5

Consider the log-log function where $fare$, for an airline ticket relates to distance (in 100 miles), $dist$, through the equation:
$$\ln(fare) = a + b \cdot \ln(dist)$$
Where
$$\ln(fare) = 4.25 + 0.40 \ln(dist)$$
We would like to understand how to interpret the coefficient on $\ln(dist)$ (i.e., 0.40). Prove that this function can be interpreted as a 10\% increase in $dist$ leads to a 4\% increase in fare.

a. Begin by writing $fare = e^{4.25}dist^{0.40}$ and taking the derivative with respect $dist$ and reworking to show that 
$$.40 = \dfrac{\partial fare/fare}{\partial dist/dist} = \dfrac{\Delta fare/fare}{\Delta dist/dist} = \dfrac{\% \Delta fare}{\% \Delta dist}$$

>**Solution:**  
>\begin{align*}  
fare = & e^{4.25}dist^{0.40}\\  
\dfrac{\partial fare}{\partial dist} = & 0.4 e^{4.25}dist^{-0.6}\\  
\dfrac{\partial fare}{\partial dist} = & 0.4 e^{4.25}*\dfrac{dist^{0.4}}{dist}\\  
\dfrac{\partial fare}{\partial dist} = & \dfrac{0.4 e^{4.25}{dist^{0.4}}}{dist}\\ 
\dfrac{\partial fare}{\partial dist/dist} = & 0.4 e^{4.25}{dist^{0.4}}\\
\dfrac{\partial fare}{\partial dist/dist} = & 0.4fare\\
\dfrac{\partial fare/fare}{\partial dist/dist} = & 0.4\\
\dfrac{\Delta fare/fare}{\Delta dist/dist} = & 0.4\\
\dfrac{\% \Delta fare}{\% \Delta dist} = & 0.4\\ 
\end{align*}

b. Since the log-log function is about percentages, let's now show that this implies that the units do not matter.  Suppose that instead of letting $dist$ taking units of 100 miles, we wrote the same function except that $dist$ takes units of miles.  Is it surprising that this function takes the form:
$$\ln(fare) = 2.40 + 0.40 \ln(dist)$$
Show that if we have $\ln(y) = a + b \ln(x)$ and $\ln(y) = a' + b' \ln(100 \times x)$ that $b=b'$ however $a \neq a'$.  (hint: you need to use the properties of $\ln$ that $\ln(a \times x) = \ln(a) + \ln(x)$)

>**Solution:**  
Let equation 1 be $\ln(y) = a + b \ln(x)$, and let equation 2 be $\ln(y) = a' + b' \ln(100 \times x)$.  
Equation 2 can be simplified as follows.

>\begin{align*}  
\ln(y) = & a' + b' \ln(100 * x)\\
= & a' + b'(\ln(100) + \ln(x))\\
= & a' + b'\ln(100) + b'\ln(x)\\ 
\end{align*}

>Setting equations 1 and 2 equal now yields:  
\begin{align*}  
a + b\ln(x) = & a' + b'\ln(100) + b'\ln(x)\\  
\end{align*}

>We see that, after grouping like terms, our constant terms are grouped together and our $ln(x)$ terms are grouped together. 

>\begin{align*}  
[a] + (b\ln(x)) = & [a' + b'\ln(100)] + (b'\ln(x))\\  
\end{align*}  

>So if the equations are truly equal, then it must be true that $b = b'$. But we see that if the constant terms are really equal, then $a = a' + b'\ln(100)$.

### Question 6

There are two types of apples, organic (eco) and conventional (reg).  An individual demand equation relating the amount of eco apples purchased in pounds ($ecolbs$) as a determined by the individual's education ($educ$) and price of eco apples and regular apples is 
$$ecolbs = 1.34 + 0.04(educ) + 3.00(regprc) -2.87(ecoprc)$$

a. Is it surprising that if the price of regular apples increases that the demand for eco apples increases?

>**Solution:**  
No. If regular apples and eco apples are substitutes then if the price of one increases, then the demand for the other will increase, and vice versa. So if the price of regular apples increase, then they will become less appealing, and individuals may purchase more eco apples.

b. What is the marginal effect of education on demand for eco apples?  Would you say individuals with more education purchase more eco apples compared to people with lower levels of education holding fixed price?

>**Solution:**  
$$\dfrac{\partial ecolbs}{\partial educ} = 0.04$$
The marginal effect of education, holding all other variables constant is 0.04. So someone with more education would increase the ecolbs, albeit slightly. So yes, someone with more education would purchase more eco apples.

c. Consider an alternative function that includes an interaction
$$ecolbs = 2.16 - 0.02(educ) + 3.00(regprc) -3.64(ecoprc) + 0.05(educ\times ecoprc)$$
Show that with this function the marginal effect of price depends on the level of education.  Who is more responsive to price, individuals with high or low levels of educations?

>**Solution:**  
Assuming the marginal effect of price means the marginal effect of ecoprc. 
$$\dfrac{\partial ecolbs}{\partial ecoprc} = -3.64 + 0.05educ$$
You would expect individuals with low levels of education to be more responsive to price. Those with higher levels of education would be less affected to the negative $3.64$ constant.

d. Given the function with interactions.  Holding fixed the price of regular apples, find the range of prices for eco apples where a person with 12 years of education will buy more eco apples than a person with 13 years of education.

>**Solution:**  
For individuals with 12 years of education and fixed regular price:  
$$ecolbs = 2.16 - 0.24 + 3.00(x) -3.64(ecoprc) + 0.60(ecoprc)$$ 
$$ecolbs = 1.92 + 3.00(regprc) - 3.04(ecoprc) $$ 
For individuals with 13 years of education and fixed regular price:
$$ecolbs = 1.9 + 3.00(regprc) -2.99(ecoprc)$$
Equating gives:
$$1.92 + 3.00(regprc) - 3.04(ecoprc) > 1.9 + 3.00(regprc) -2.99(ecoprc)$$
$$0.02 > 0.05(ecoprc)$$
$$\dfrac{2}{5} > ecoprc$$
So we see that individuals who have 12 years of education will buy more apples than those with 13 years of education for prices of eco apples less than 40 cents.

e. Using this function, plot the relationship between eco pounds demanded and education for low price of eco-apples \$0.90 and a high price of eco-apples \$1.30, assuming the price of regular apples is \$0.90 in both situations.  Hint: here you are plotting $ecolbs$ on the y-axis against $educ$ on the x-axis holding fixed eco-price and regular apple price.  Does this plot illustrate which group of buyers, high education v. low education are most sensitive to price changes of eco-apples?

>**Solution:**  
>```{R}
lowecoprice<- 0.9
highecoprice<-1.3
regprice<-0.9
education<- 0:20
low_price_ecolbs<- 2.16 - 0.02*education + 3.00*regprice - 3.64*lowecoprice + 0.05*lowecoprice*education
high_price_ecolbs<- 2.16 - 0.02*education + 3.00*regprice - 3.64*highecoprice + 0.05*highecoprice*education

plot(education, low_price_ecolbs, col = "blue", ylim = c(0,3.5), ylab = "Ecolbs", 'l')
lines(education, high_price_ecolbs, col = "red", "l")
legend(0, 3.25, legend = c("Low Eco Price", "High Eco Price"), col = c("blue","red"), lty = c(1,1))
```
The plot illustrates those with lower levels of education tend to be more sensitive to the changes in price of eco apples. This is shown by the slope of the High Eco Price, it's much steeper, showing that as education increases they care less about the price of the eco apple.

### Question 7

a. Suppose the number of applicants to a university ($apps$) is a function of whether in the previous year the University participated in a bowl game ($bowl$), whether the mens' basketball team was conference champs, $btitle$, or whether the mens' basketball team was in the final four $finfour$.  Each of these variables $bowl$, $btitle$, and $finfour$ is an indicator variable, taking a value of 1 if true and zero otherwise.

    What is the meaning of the intercept in the function below
$$apps = 9677.14 + 1423.23(bowl) + 410.16(btitle) + 2952.49(finfour)$$

>**Solution:**  
The intercept represents the number of applications the university receives, provided it did not appear in a bowl game, their men's basketball team was not conference champs, and their men's basketball team did not appear in the final four.

b. Monthly US presidential approval ratings for the years 2001 to 2007 can be described by the following equation
$$ approve = b_0 + b_1 rgasprice + b_2 katrina + b_3 iraqinvade + b_4 sep11$$
Where $rgasprice$ is real gas price, $katrina$ is an indicator variable if it was the month of hurricane Katrina, $iraqinvade$ is an indicator if it was the month the US invaded Iraq, and $sep11$ is an indicator if the month was September 2001.

    In fact assume the relationship can be precisely defined as
$$ approve = 101.25 - 0.50 rgasprice + 14.76 katrina + 6.75 iraqinvade + 22.54 sep11$$
What is the meaning of the intercept in the function above?

>**Solution:**  
The intercept is the approval rating when the real gas price equals zero, it is not the month of hurricane Katrina, it is not the month the US invaded Iraq, and not the month of September 2001. So if the real gas price and all the indicator value are 0, then the presidential approval rating would be 101.25 (an impossible approval rating), but since real gas price would likely never be 0, factoring in the real gas price would give you a more realistic presidential approval rating.
